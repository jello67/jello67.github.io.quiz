My project is called Quiz and it is a quiz game where you can test your knowledge and learn trivia. I made my project to be a fun game to test your knowledge. I made my project using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and incorporated buttons and made it so that the user would get feedback on if their answer was correct or not. I struggled with getting the project to be able to respond and learned how to put answers as right or wrong and state the correct answer.
